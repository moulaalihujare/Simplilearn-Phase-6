**1.0 Go to official Amazon Web Services site**

```bash
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2
```

**2.0 Create New Instance**

**3.0 Connect to the Instance**

**4.0 Open Command Prompt in your machine and navigate to the path where you have downloaded the pem file**

```bash
cd Downloads
```

**5.0 Connect to EC2 Instance by executing the '3rd and example' commands in the ec2 instance**

```bash
chmod 400 my-movie-plan.pem
ssh -i "my-movie-plan.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-172-237-186.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

**6.0 Update the Instance Once connected using the following command**

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

**7.0 After updating the instance, install Java using the following command**

```bash
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```

**7.1 Check if Java is installed or not by executing the java version command**

```bash
sudo java -version 
```

**8.0 Install Maven**

```bash
sudo yum install maven
```

**8.1 Check Maven version**

```

```bash
sudo yum install jenkins
```

**10.1 Start Jenkins after installing**

```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

**10.2 Check if Jenkins is running on port 8080 along with Public IPv4 addresses like:**

```bash
Example:
The IPv4 addresses of my instance is: 54.172.237.186
The Jenkins is running on 8080 port: 8080
Finally, use both to view jenkins: '54.172.237.186:8080'
```

**10.3 For the first time Jenkins will ask for password, to find the password, execute the following command in the EC2
Instance console**

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

**10.4 Install the recommended plugins in the jenkins after logging in. After installing plugins, jenkins will prompt to
create an admin user, go-head and create the user**

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

```

**11.2 Amazon Linux**

```bash

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
```

**11.6 Reboot the EC2 instance to pick up the new docker group permissions.**

```bash
sudo reboot
```

**12.0 After rebooting the EC2 Instance, execute the following commands.**

**12.1 Start Docker**

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**12.2 Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without sudo.**
